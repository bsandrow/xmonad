Get the processor usage on xmonad-bottom-bar.sh down. Creating
some sort of event-loop with callback hooks, scheduled
wake-ups and the possibility of needing to port this to perl
or python (or C). Would like to generalize it as much as
possible so that it's not only "you can with with this
only the things that I care about"
