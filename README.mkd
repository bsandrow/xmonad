Install
-------

    $ cd path/to/repo/xmonad
    $ make install

Also note that '~/scripts' has to be in your path, or you can redefine the BINDIR by installing like so:

    $ cd path/to/repo/xmonad
    $ make 'BINDIR=$(PREFIX)/bin' install

Files
-----
 * __xmonad.hs__ The config file
 * __bak__ Where unsed files go to die
 * __scripts__ Helper scripts to my Xmonad setup
 * __Makefile__ self-explanatory
